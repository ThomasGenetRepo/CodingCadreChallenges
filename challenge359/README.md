# Challenge #359: Manipulating Dates
Whether you're a data Analyst/Engineer/Scientist, or a software engineer, and Excel wizard, etc...manipulating and dealing with dates (and datetimes) is a sure source of frustration. And it's exactly what this challenge is about :grinning: <br><br>
This challenge consists of transforming a column of dates with a given date format into another date format. The dates in the column come in the format MM/dd/yyyy, and the challenge is getting them into the format yyyy/quarter. For Example:<br>
- 02/02/2022 would need to be transformed into 2022Q1
